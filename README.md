# Simple-Image-Editor-using-python
I have created a simple editor in python using the pillow library that enhances an image and convert it to Black and white.
Make sure you have pillow library installed, you can do that by simply typing **pip install pillow** in your terminal or powershell
If this doesnt work, i request you to create a folder named 'images' to store the images that you want to edit and another folder named 'editedImages' to which the code will automatically edit a certain filter and store images
